## Recoding multivariate variables: `case_when()`

The mother's race is encoded as integers from 1 through 8:

.small-font[

```r
NCbirths %&gt;%
  pull(RaceMom) %&gt;%
  unique() # list all the unique values (ordered by first occurrence)
```

```
[1] 1 5 2 3 4 7 8

## Recoding multivariate variables: `case_when()`



We use `case_when()` to recode multiple values all at once:

.xtiny-font.pull-left[

```r
NCbirths %&gt;%
  mutate(
    RaceMom = case_when(
      RaceMom == 1 ~ "white",
      RaceMom == 2 ~ "black",
      RaceMom == 3 ~ "American Indian",
      RaceMom == 4 ~ "Chinese",
      RaceMom == 5 ~ "Japanese",
      RaceMom == 6 ~ "Hawaiian",
      RaceMom == 7 ~ "Filipino",
      RaceMom == 8 ~ 
        "Other Asian or Pacific Islander",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_ # should never reach
    )
  ) %&gt;%
  pull(RaceMom)
```
]
